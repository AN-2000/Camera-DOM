<!-- In this POC we will learn to draw lines and shapes on canvas. To do this we have brought over the code from canvas-1 POC and deleted the conversation  -->

<!-- C1 -->

<!-- Steps involved:
1- No new steps are involved just using the same code and calling functions which draw shapes-->

      // canvas follows a grid system of x,y coordinate with origin being at top left corner. x increases from moving left to right and y increase in moving from top to bottom and vice versa
      
      //C2.2
      // properties like beginPath and closePath are ignored (not taught and will not be used) and hence all comments are written in accordance with that

      //C2.3
      //the moveTo function just moves the drawing cursor without actually drawing anything, to draw you have to call lineTo or functions like fillRect to draw shape
      //the lines you draw using lineTo will be only visible after you call stroke method

      //C2.4
      // In this example we are making the background black by drawing a black rectangle in the entire background and then drawing a green tick on it, after you have taught this in class you can give a break point if you want and ask them to draw a red cross.

      //C2.5
      // whenever you start drawing on canvas you first need to call moveTo and set an initial position.
      ctx.moveTo(0, 0);

      //C2.6
      // this function draw a rectangle at x,y coordinate of given height and width
      ctx.fillRect(0,0,window.innerWidth,window.innerHeight)


      //C2.7
      ctx.moveTo(100,100)
      //here we are changing the width of the line that is drawn
      ctx.lineWidth = 150;
      //here we are changing the colour of the lines that are drawn
      ctx.strokeStyle = "green";
      ctx.lineTo(300, window.innerHeight - 100);
      ctx.lineTo(window.innerWidth - 100, 100);
      //without this function call the above lines that are drawn using lineTo will not be visible
      ctx.stroke()
