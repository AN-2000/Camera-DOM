<!-- In this POC we will see learn to use canvas api and draw paths and shapes  -->

<!-- C1 -->

<!-- Steps involved:
1- Create basic html and add a canvas element in the body. Add script and reference the canvas element in JS.
2- Set the canvas to cover the entire screen size. You can do this by using css together with JS. In JS using the canvas reference set its height and width to window's inner height and width. In css, first set the body's margin to 0 and set canvas display to block 
3-Get canvas context and draw paths and shapes -->

    <script>
      // C2.2
      let canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");

      // C2.3
      // setting the height and width of canvas to window's height and width
      canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
      canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

      // C2.4
      //   The <canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this POC, we focus on the 2D rendering context.

      // Here is how we get access to 2d context of our canvas element we are going to use this to draw on canvas
      let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

      // C3.1
      // canvas follows a grid system of x,y coordinate with origin being at top left corner. x increases from moving left to right and y increase in moving from top to bottom and vice versa
      
      //C3.2
      // Whenever we create a new canvas all the lines we draw are part of a single path. You can create a new path using beginPath, whenever we create a canvas this function is automatically called for us. But its a good practice to explicitly call it whenever you start creating lines for a specific path(just after starting new canvas)

      //C3.3
      //the moveTo function just moves the drawing cursor without actually drawing anything, to draw you have to call lineTo or functions like fillRect to draw shape
      //the lines you draw using lineTo will be only visible after you call stroke method

      //C3.4
      // In this example we are making the background black by drawing a black rectangle in the entire background and then drawing a green tick on it, after you have taught this in class you can give a break point if you want and ask them to draw a red cross.

      ctx.beginPath();
      //C3.5
      // When the current path is empty, such as immediately after calling beginPath(), or on a newly created canvas, the first path construction command is always treated as a moveTo(), regardless of what it actually is. For that reason, you will almost always want to specifically set your starting position after resetting a path.
      ctx.moveTo(0, 0);

      //C3.6
      // this function draw a rectangle at x,y coordinate of given height and width
      ctx.fillRect(0, 0, window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

      //C3.7
      ctx.moveTo(100, 100);
      //here we are changing the width of the line that is drawn
      ctx.lineWidth = 150;
      //here we are changing the colour of the lines that are drawn
      ctx.strokeStyle = "green";
      ctx.lineTo(300, window.innerHeight - 100);
      ctx.lineTo(window.innerWidth - 100, 100);
      //without this function call the above lines that are drawn using lineTo will not be visible
      ctx.stroke();
